He wrangles PowerSchool like a bard with a lute—graceful, precise, and dangerously effective. Need a school schedule optimized down to the second? He’s your guy. Need a tiefling bard with panpipes leading an orc ambush in a charcoal-sketch art style? Also your guy.

He blends code, creativity, and charisma—designing tools for educators, building plugins that make schools smarter, and dreaming up logos, flags, and cartoon scenes with relentless precision. Whether he's sketching antelope-skulled pirate banners or streamlining database queries, Jordan doesn’t just solve problems—he stylizes them.

One foot in the classroom, the other in a fantasy campaign. One hand on the terminal, the other sketching heroes.
